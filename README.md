# PPARa-Index

Food composition table with 2000 foods is fetched from: https://www.matportalen.no/verktoy/the_norwegian_food_composition_table/#guide

Search for the foods you want to check the PPARa-Index of and compare to other foods. Note that this is not 100% accurate, but should be a simple way to compare different foods and the foods effect on the PPARa transcriptional activity.

The PPARa-Index for foods are weighted according to this graph:

For example:

Fatty acids that pull the PPAR-Index up:
- C12:0, weight of 1;
- C16:1, weight of 1;
- C18:1, weight of 1;
- C18:3n-3, weight of 1.5;
- C18:2n-6, weight of 0.25;

Fatty acids that pulls the PPAR-Index down:
- C14:0, weight of 0.25;
- C16:0, weight of 0.5;
- C18:0, weight of 0.25;
